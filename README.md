# DjembeDB

## An open source collection of fine hand-percussion rythms

This project was created to help collecting and learning hand percussion grooves. These beats are very well suited for Djembe as well as Cajon players.

### Collaborative and open source

I'm a designer by trade, I code in the weekend as a hobby. As a result, developing new features is often a daunting task that requires skills and knowledge I don't always have the time to acquire.
